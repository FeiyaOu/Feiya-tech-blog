#React Notes 6
## 1 function StarRating({ maxRating = 5 }) {
  //we can set a default value for the prop, in this case, it is 5.

## 2 <p style={textStyle}>{rating || ""}</p>
      {/* || returns the first truthy value it encounters or the last value 
      if the two are all falsy */}

## 3 <span role="button" style={starStyle}> 
    Normally, a <button> element has built-in accessibility features:

     1 It is focusable (tabindex=0 by default).
     2 It is clickable and activates on Enter/Space keys.
     3 Screen readers announce it as a "button."

However, a <span> is just a plain text container and lacks these behaviors. By adding role="button", you:
    1 Tell screen readers that the <span> should be treated as a button.
    2 Improve accessibility for users who navigate using assistive devices.
     
     Key points: 
     1 role="button": Tells assistive technologies this behaves like a button.
     2 onClick: Adds interactive behavior. 

##4 Array.from()

### example1 :

const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

const result = Array.from(numbers, (num, i) => (
  <span key={i}>{num * 2} (Index: {i})</span>
));

console.log(result);
//////
Expected output as React JSX:

[
  <span key={0}>20 (Index: 0)</span>,
  <span key={1}>40 (Index: 1)</span>,
  <span key={2}>60 (Index: 2)</span>,
  <span key={3}>80 (Index: 3)</span>,
  <span key={4}>100 (Index: 4)</span>
]

### example2 :

Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, i) => <span>S{i + 1}</span>)

Output:

[
  <span>S1</span>,
  <span>S2</span>,
  <span>S3</span>,
  <span>S4</span>,
  <span>S5</span>
]

## 5 How React render an array wrapped by <div> 
<div>
  {[<span>s1</span>, <span>s2</span>, <span>s3</span>]}
</div>
JSX does not treat the array as a separate entityâ€”instead, it extracts the elements from the array and renders them in sequence inside the <div>.
In other words, it unwraps the array and places the individual elements in the DOM.
This means the browser will see:

<div>
  <span>s1</span>
  <span>s2</span>
  <span>s3</span>
</div>

Since <span> is an inline element, it appears as:

s1s2s3
