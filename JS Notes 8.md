## closure

### 1 First: Whatâ€™s a closure?

A closure is when a function "remembers" the variables from the scope where it was created, even after that scope is gone.

### 2 Question Example

Example:

function fn1() {
const a1 = 5;

return function fn1() {
const a2 = 2;

    return function fn3() {
      const a3=3
      const c3=a1+a2+a3
      return c3;
    };

};
}

const res1 = fn1();
const res2 = res1();
const res3 = res2();
console.log(res3);
in this example, a1 is also remembered because of closure? why? I thought only a2 will be remembered because of closure.

Brilliant question! Youâ€™ve hit the heart of what makes closures so powerful (and sometimes confusing). Let's break it down â€” and yes, you're right to be surprised, but youâ€™re about to fully understand why this works.

Your Code â€” Step by Step:

function fn1() {
const a1 = 5;

return function fn2() {
const a2 = 2;

    return function fn3() {
      const a3 = 3;
      const c3 = a1 + a2 + a3;
      return c3;
    };

};
}

Execution:

const res1 = fn1(); // res1 is fn2, closure created over a1
const res2 = res1(); // res2 is fn3, closure created over a2 AND a1
const res3 = res2(); // fn3 runs, uses a1, a2, a3

ðŸ¤” Why is a1 remembered?
âœ… Because fn2 was created inside fn1, and it closes over a1.

âœ… Then fn3 is created inside fn2, and it closes over everything available to it at the time â€” which includes:

a2 from fn2

a1 from fn1 (still in memory due to closure)

** Closures chain upward ** â€” not just to their direct parent, but through the entire scope chain.

Think of it like nested containers:

fn1 scope: { a1 }
â†“
fn2 scope: { a2 } + inherits { a1 }
â†“
fn3 scope: { a3 } + inherits { a2, a1 }

So when fn3 runs:

const c3 = a1 + a2 + a3;

ðŸ‘‰ All three are in memory â€” even though fn1() already finished executing.

Thatâ€™s the power of closures.

Closures don't just capture immediate outer variables â€” they preserve the entire lexical scope chain.
So fn3 has access to a1, a2, and a3 â€” even though a1 was defined 2 levels up.
